In the event of a conflict between the terms of these Service Terms and the terms of the AWS Customer Agreement or other agreement with us governing your use of our Services (the **“Agreement”**), the terms and conditions of these Service Terms apply, but only to the extent of such conflict. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.\n\n#### 1\\. Universal Service Terms (Applicable to All Services)\n\n**1.1.** You may only use the Services to store, retrieve, query, serve, and execute Your Content that is owned, licensed or lawfully obtained by you. As used in these Service Terms, (a) “Your Content” includes any “Company Content” and any “Customer Content” and (b) “AWS Content” includes “Amazon Properties”. As part of the Services, you may be allowed to use certain software (including related documentation) provided by us or third party licensors. This software is neither sold nor distributed to you and you may use it solely as part of the Services. You may not transfer it outside the Services without specific authorization to do so.\n\n**1.2.** You must comply with the current technical documentation applicable to the Services (including the applicable developer guides) as posted by us and updated by us from time to time on the AWS Site. In addition, if you create technology that works with a Service, you must comply with the current technical documentation applicable to that Service (including the applicable developer guides) as posted by us and updated by us from time to time on the AWS Site.\n\n**1.3.** You will provide information or other materials related to Your Content (including copies of any client-side applications) as reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with the Agreement. We may monitor the external interfaces (e.g., ports) of Your Content to verify your compliance with the Agreement. You will not block or interfere with our monitoring, but you may use encryption technology or firewalls to help keep Your Content confidential. You will reasonably cooperate with us to identify the source of any problem with the Services that we reasonably believe may be attributable to Your Content or any end user materials that you control.\n\n**1.4.** If we reasonably believe any of Your Content violates the law, infringes or misappropriates the rights of any third party or otherwise violates a material term of the Agreement (including the documentation, the Service Terms, or the Acceptable Use Policy) (“Prohibited Content”), we will notify you of the Prohibited Content and may request that such content be removed from the Services or access to it be disabled. If you do not remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content within 2 business days of our notice, we may remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content or suspend the Services to the extent we are not able to remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may remove or disable access to any Prohibited Content without prior notice in connection with illegal content, where the content may disrupt or threaten the Services, pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or as required to comply with law or any judicial, regulatory or other governmental order or request. In the event that we remove content without prior notice, we will provide prompt notice to you unless prohibited by law. We terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.\n\n**1.5.** From time to time, we may offer free or discounted pricing programs covering certain usage of the Services (each, a “Special Pricing Program”). We may stop accepting new sign-ups or discontinue a Special Pricing Program at any time. Standard charges will apply after a Special Pricing Program ends or if you exceed the limitations by the Special Pricing Program. You must comply with any additional terms, restrictions, or limitations (e.g., limitations on the total amount of usage) for the Special Pricing Program as described in the offer terms for the Special Pricing Program or on the pricing page for the eligible Service(s). You may not access or use the Services in a way intended to avoid any additional terms, restrictions, or limitations (e.g., establishing multiple AWS accounts in order to receive additional benefits under a Special Pricing Program), and we may immediately terminate your account if you do so. Any data stored or instances provided as part of a Special Pricing Program must be actively used.\n\n**1.6.** If we make multiple discounts or pricing options for a Service available to you at one time, you will only be eligible to receive one discount or pricing option, and will not be entitled to cumulative discounting and pricing options.\n\n**1.7.** You will ensure that all information you provide to us via the AWS Site (for instance, information provided in connection with your registration for the Services, requests for increased usage limits, etc.) is accurate, complete and not misleading.\n\n**1.8.** From time to time, we may apply upgrades, patches, bug fixes or other maintenance to the Service Offerings (“Maintenance”). We agree to use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice of any scheduled Maintenance (except for emergency Maintenance) and you agree to use reasonable efforts to comply with any Maintenance requirements that we notify you about.\n\n**1.9.** If your Agreement does not include a provision on AWS Confidential Information, and you and AWS do not have an effective non-disclosure agreement in place, then you agree that you will not disclose AWS Confidential Information (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement), except as required by law.\n\n**1.10.** Beta Service Participation\n\n**1.10.1.** This Section describes the additional terms and conditions under which you may access and use certain features, technologies and services made available to you by AWS that are not yet generally available, including, but not limited to, any products, services, or features labeled “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental” (each, a “Beta Service”) or access and use Service Offerings available in AWS regions that are not generally available, including, but not limited to, any AWS regions identified by AWS as “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental” (each, a “Beta Region”). In the event there is a conflict between the terms of this Section 1.10 and an existing AWS Beta Test Participation Agreement between you and AWS, the terms of the existing AWS Beta Test Participation Agreement will take precedence.\n\n**1.10.2.** During the term of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region (as specified by AWS), you may: (a) access and use the Beta Service or Service Offerings in any Beta Region solely for internal evaluation purposes; and (b) install, copy, and use any related AWS Content that may be provided to you by AWS in connection with the Beta Service or Service Offerings in any Beta Region (“Beta Materials”) solely as necessary to access and use the Beta Service or Service Offerings in any Beta Region in the manner permitted by this Section.\n\n**1.10.3.** You agree not to allow access to or use of any Beta Service, Service Offerings in any Beta Region or Beta Materials by any third party other than your employees and contractors who (i) have a need to use or access the Beta Service, Service Offerings in the Beta Region or Beta Materials in connection with your internal evaluation activities, and (ii) have executed written non-disclosure agreements obligating them to protect the confidentiality of non-public information regarding the Beta Service, Beta Region and Beta Materials.\n\n**1.10.4.** You must comply with all policies and guidelines related to any Beta Service or Beta Region as posted on the AWS Site or otherwise made available to you, including the Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, the Service Terms, and any additional terms and conditions for a specific Beta Service or Beta Region. AWS may add or modify restrictions, including lowering or raising any usage limits, related to access to or use of any Beta Service, Service Offerings in any Beta Region or Beta Materials at any time. If requested by AWS, you will promptly increase or decrease your usage of the applicable Beta Service, Service Offerings in a Beta Region or Beta Materials to the levels that AWS may specify. Service Level Agreements do not apply to Beta Services or any Services Offerings in Beta Regions.\n\n**1.10.5.** AWS may suspend or terminate your access to or use of any Beta Service or Service Offerings in any Beta Region at any time and for any reason. AWS may at any time cease providing any or all of any Beta Service or any Service Offering in a Beta Region in its sole discretion and without notice. Beta Services and Services Offerings in Beta Regions also may be unavailable and/or their performance may be negatively affected by scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. AWS will use reasonable efforts to notify you in advance of scheduled maintenance, but AWS is unable to provide advance notice of unscheduled or emergency maintenance.\n\n**1.10.6.** In consideration of being allowed to access and use a Beta Service or Service Offering in a Beta Region, you agree to provide AWS with information relating to your access, use, testing, or evaluation of the Beta Service, Service Offerings in the Beta Region or any related Beta Materials, including observations or information regarding the performance, features and functionality of the Beta Service or any related Beta Materials as applicable, when and in the form reasonably requested by AWS (“Test Observations”). AWS will own and may use and evaluate all Test Observations for its own purposes. You will not use any Test Observations except for your internal evaluation purposes of the Beta Service or Beta Region.\n\n**1.10.7.** Each individual Beta Service and Service Offering in a Beta Region will automatically terminate upon the release of a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Service Offering in a Beta Region or upon notice of termination by AWS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or these Services Terms, either you or AWS may terminate your participation in a Beta Service or Service Offering in a Beta Region at any time for any reason upon notice to the other party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, after the conclusion of your participation in a Beta Service or Service Offering in a Beta Region for any reason, (a) you will not have any further right to access or use the applicable Beta Service or Service Offering in the Beta Region and Beta Materials; (b) your Content used in the applicable Beta Service or Service Offering in the Beta Region may be deleted or inaccessible; and (c) you will immediately return or, if instructed by AWS, destroy all Beta Materials or any other AWS Confidential Information related to the applicable Beta Service, Service Offering in any Beta Region or Beta Materials. If AWS releases a generally available version of a Beta Service or a Service Offering in a Beta Region, your access to and use of the generally available version will be subject to the Agreement and any separate Section of these Service Terms as may be specified for that generally available Service Offering. If any Beta Region becomes generally available, your access to and use of Service Offerings in the generally available AWS region will be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to that AWS region. AWS does not guarantee that any Beta Service or Service Offering in any Beta Region will ever be made generally available, or that any generally available version will contain the same or similar functionality as the version made available by AWS during the term of the Beta Service or Beta Region, as applicable. AWS does not guarantee that any Beta Region will become generally available.\n\n**1.10.8.** Beta Materials, Test Observations, Suggestions concerning a Beta Service or Beta Region, or any other information about or involving (including the existence of) any Beta Service or Beta Region are considered AWS Confidential Information. You will not disclose (including, but not limited to, in a press release or public statement) any Beta Materials, Test Observations, Suggestions concerning a Beta Service, or any other information about or involving (including the existence of) any Beta Service, except as agreed by AWS in writing.\n\n**1.10.9.** ADDITIONAL WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMERS IN THE AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE TERMS, THE BETA SERVICES, SERVICE OFFERINGS IN BETA REGIONS, BETA REGIONS AND BETA MATERIALS ARE NOT READY FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, DEFECTS OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ACCORDINGLY, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE AGREEMENT OR THESE SERVICES TERMS, AWS IS PROVIDING THE BETA SERVICES, SERVICE OFFERINGS IN BETA REGIONS AND BETA MATERIALS TO YOU “AS IS.” AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE REGARDING THE BETA SERVICES, SERVICE OFFERINGS IN BETA REGIONS, BETA REGIONS AND BETA MATERIALS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY THAT THE BETA SERVICES, SERVICE OFFERINGS IN BETA REGIONS, BETA REGIONS AND BETA MATERIALS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING YOUR CONTENT, WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR DAMAGED. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. AWS’ AND ITS AFFILIATES’ AND LICENSORS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY BETA SERVICES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU ACTUALLY PAY US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE BETA SERVICES THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.\n\n**1.10.10.** Because the Beta Services and Materials involve features, technologies and services that are not yet generally available, you acknowledge that any violation of this Section 1.10 could cause irreparable harm to AWS for which monetary damages may be difficult to ascertain or an inadequate remedy. You therefore agree that AWS will have the right, in addition to its other rights and remedies, to seek injunctive relief for any violation of this Section 1.10.\n\n**1.11.** You may perform benchmarks or comparative tests or evaluations (each, a “Benchmark”) of the Service Offerings. If you perform or disclose, or direct or permit any third party to perform or disclose, any Benchmark of any of the Service Offerings, you (i) will include in any disclosure, and will disclose to us, all information necessary to replicate such Benchmark, and (ii) agree that we may perform and disclose the results of Benchmarks of your products or services, irrespective of any restrictions on Benchmarks in the terms governing your products or services.\n\n**1.12.** Only the applicable AWS Contracting Party (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement) will have obligations with respect to each AWS account, and no other AWS Contracting Party has any obligation with respect to such account. The AWS Contracting Party for an account may change as described in the Agreement. Invoices for each account will reflect the AWS Contracting Party that is responsible for that account during the applicable billing period.\n\nIf, as of the time of a change of the AWS Contracting Party responsible for your account, you have made an up-front payment for any EC2 Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, Reserved DB Instances, Reserved Cache Nodes, Amazon DynamoDB Reserved Capacity, or Reserved Nodes (each as defined in these Service Terms for the applicable Service) under such account, then the AWS Contracting Party you paid such up-front payment to will remain the AWS Contracting Party for the applicable account only with respect to the Services related to such up-front payment.\n\n**1.13.** If you are a customer that is subject to the French Politique générale de sécurité des systems d’information de santé (PGSSI-S), you agree that your use of AWS Offerings complies with the PGSSI-S.\n\n**1.14.** Service Availability. You should not pay charges for Services while they are unavailable (as defined in the applicable Service Level Agreement for each Service). To the extent you have been charged for a Service for a period when that Service was unavailable, you may request a Service Credit equal to any such amounts.\n\n#### 2\\. Amazon CloudFront\n\n**2.1.** You must own or have all necessary rights to use any domain name or SSL certificate that you use in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront. You are solely responsible for the renewal, security and proper configuration of any SSL certificates that you provide for use with Amazon CloudFront, including any disclosure of your SSL certificates to third parties.\n\n**2.2.** Amazon CloudFront requires you to store the original version of Your Content in an origin server (such as Amazon S3). If you use other Services to store the original version of Your Content, you are responsible for the separate fees you accrue for the other Services and for Amazon CloudFront.\n\n**2.3.** While you will only be charged fees specified for the selected Price Class, Your Content you select for delivery from edge locations in a Price Class may from time to time be served from edge locations located outside the regions in that Price Class.\n\n**2.4.** Amazon CloudFront’s Geo Restriction feature may utilize a third party geo-location database, which may not be accurate in all situations.\n\n#### 3\\. Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)\n\n**3.1.** You may not knowingly create and maintain inactive queues. We may delete, without liability of any kind, any of Your Content that sits in an Amazon SQS queue or any Amazon SQS queue that remains inactive for more than the number of days specified in the user documentation.\n\n#### 4\\. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\n\n**4.1.** In connection with your use of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (including all instances and instance types, hosts and other resources, dedicated, reserved or on-demand, collectively “Amazon EC2”) and the Services, you are responsible for maintaining licenses and adhering to the license terms of any software you run.\n\n**4.2.** Using Microsoft Software. In conjunction with the Services, you may be allowed to use certain software (including related documentation) developed and owned by Microsoft Corporation or its licensors (collectively, the “Microsoft Software”).\n\n**4.2.1.** If you choose to use the Microsoft Software, Microsoft and its licensors require that you agree to these additional terms and conditions:\n\n**•** The Microsoft Software is neither sold nor distributed to you and you may use it solely in conjunction with the Services.\n\n**•** You may not transfer or use the Microsoft Software outside the Services.\n\n**•** You may not remove, modify or obscure any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices that are contained in or on the Microsoft Software.\n\n**•** You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Microsoft Software, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law.\n\n**•** Microsoft disclaims, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all warranties by Microsoft and any liability by Microsoft or its suppliers for any damages, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from the Services.\n\n**•** Microsoft is not responsible for providing any support in connection with the Services. Do not contact Microsoft for support.\n\n**•** You are not granted any right to use the Microsoft Software in any application controlling aircraft or other modes of human mass transportation, nuclear or chemical facilities, life support systems, implantable medical equipment, motor vehicles, weaponry systems, or any similar scenario (collectively, “High Risk Use”). Microsoft and its suppliers disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Use. High Risk Use does not include utilization of the Microsoft Software for administrative purposes, to store configuration data, engineering and/or configuration tools, or other non-control applications, the failure of which would not result in death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. These non-controlling applications may communicate with the applications that perform the control, but must not be directly or indirectly responsible for the control function.\n\n**•** Microsoft is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Section 4.2.1, with the right to enforce its provisions.\n\n**4.2.2.** For any instance running Microsoft Software (each, a “Microsoft Instance”), you may not use nesting, container or similar technologies to sell or resell multiple instances, portion(s) of an instance, or containers running within the Microsoft Instance, unless (a) you are the ultimate end user of the Microsoft Instance, (b) you have supplemented the Microsoft Instance with your own applications, or (c) you have added primary and significant functionality to the Microsoft Instance.\n\n**4.3.** Using Third Party Software. In conjunction with the Services, you may be allowed to use certain software (including related support, maintenance, and documentation) developed, owned or provided by third parties or their licensors. Use of third party software is subject to these additional terms and conditions:\n\n**•** By using NVIDIA Corporation’s software, toolkits and drivers, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the NVIDIA Cloud End User License Agreement, Amazon Web Services User located at https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/NVidiaEULAforAWS.pdf.\n\n**•** By using Red Hat, Inc.’s software, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Red Hat Cloud Software Subscription Agreement located at www.redhat.com/licenses/cloud\\_cssa/. Red Hat also disclaims any (i) warranties with respect to Red Hat, Inc. software; and (ii) liability for any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential, and any loss of profits, revenue, data or data use, arising from use of Red Hat, Inc. software.\n\n**•** By using SUSE LLC’s software, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the SUSE End User License Agreement located at https://www.suse.com/licensing/eula and the SUSE Terms and Conditions located at https://www.suse.com/products/terms\\_and\\_conditions.pdf.\n\n**4.4.** Spot Instance Pricing. You may request that certain Amazon EC2 instances run pursuant to the Spot instance pricing and payment terms (“Spot Instance Pricing”) set forth on the Amazon EC2 product detail page on the AWS Site (each requested instance, a “Spot Instance”). You must request Spot Instances through the AWS Management Console or by using API tools (“Spot Instance Request”). As part of your Spot Instance Request, you may specify the maximum hourly price you are willing to pay to run the requested Spot Instances (“Your Maximum Price”). Unless you specify a permissible alternative termination date, your Spot Instance Request will remain active until the earlier of the following: (1) seven (7) days have passed, (2) we fulfill it, or (3) you cancel it. We set the price for Spot Instances (the “Spot Price”), which may vary over time based on a number of factors, including the amount of available compute capacity we have available and the price you and other customers are willing to pay for Spot Instances (e.g., supply and demand). While a requested Spot Instance remains running, you will be charged the current Spot Price in effect at the beginning of each instance hour. If you have specified Your Maximum Price, then you will not be charged more than Your Maximum Price. We may terminate, stop, or hibernate Spot Instances at any time and without any notice to you if we determine the current Spot Price equals or exceeds Your Maximum Price (if specified) or for AWS capacity requirements. If we terminate, stop, or hibernate your Spot Instance, you will be charged as described on the Amazon EC2 product detail page on the AWS Site. AWS may allow you to purchase Spot Instances of a fixed duration (each, a “Spot Block”), where the Spot Price for that Spot Instance (the “Block Price”) will remain constant for the duration of the Spot Block, and you will be charged the Block Price for the duration of your Spot Block. Spot Instances purchased as Spot Blocks run independently of the Spot Price, and will not be terminated because the Spot Price equals or exceeds Your Maximum Price (if specified). Spot Instances purchased as Spot Blocks may still be terminated for AWS capacity requirements and will terminate at the conclusion of the fixed duration. If a Spot Instance purchased as a Spot Block is terminated due to AWS capacity requirements, you will not be charged for that Spot Instance. Unless you designate your Spot Instance Request as a persistent request, terminated, stopped or hibernated Spot Instances may not automatically restart. You should save your work frequently and test your application to ensure it is fault tolerant and will correctly handle interruptions. We have no liability whatsoever for any damages, liabilities, losses (including any corruption, deletion, or destruction or loss of data, applications or profits), or any other consequences resulting from our termination, stoppage, or hibernation of any Spot Instance. Spot Instances may not be used with certain Services, features and third-party software we specify, including Amazon DevPay, IBM software packages, or Microsoft SQL Server. You may not, directly, indirectly, alone or in cooperation with any third party, attempt to control, influence or manipulate the price for Spot Instances. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not submit requests for Spot Instances through any third party (e.g., “proxy bidding”) or share information with any third party regarding the maximum prices specified in your Spot Instance Requests. We may modify or terminate the Spot Instance Pricing program at any time. In addition to the Spot Instance Pricing, Spot Instances are subject to all data transfer and other usage fees applicable under the Agreement.\n\n**4.5.** EC2 Reserved Instance Pricing; Savings Plans. You may designate Amazon EC2 instances as subject to the reserved pricing and payment terms (“EC2 Reserved Instance Pricing”) set forth on the Amazon EC2 detail page on the AWS Site (each designated instance, an “EC2 Reserved Instance”). Scheduled EC2 Reserved Instances (“Scheduled Instances”) will terminate upon completion of the scheduled reservation. You may designate instances as EC2 Reserved Instances by calling to the Purchasing API or selecting the EC2 Reserved Instance option in the AWS console. The EC2 Reserved Instances may only be used in the applicable AWS region. We may change EC2 Reserved Instance and Savings Plans pricing at any time but price changes will not apply to previously designated EC2 Reserved Instances or Savings Plans, except as described in this Section 4.5. If Microsoft increases the license fees it charges for Windows, or if Red Hat increases the license fees it charges for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (“RHEL”), we may make a corresponding increase to the per-hour usage rate (or institute a corresponding per-hour usage rate) for EC2 Reserved Instances with, or Savings Plans prices for, Windows or RHEL. Any increase in (or institution of) the per-hour usage rate for EC2 Reserved Instances with, or Savings Plans prices for, Windows will be made between December 1 and January 31, and we will provide 30 days’ notice. For any increase in (or institution of) the per-hour usage rate for EC2 Reserved Instances with, or Savings Plans prices for, RHEL we will provide 30 days’ notice. If this happens, you may: (a) continue to use your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL with the new per-hour usage price; (b) convert your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL to comparable EC2 Reserved Instances with Linux; or (c) terminate your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL and receive a pro rata refund of the up-front fee you paid for the terminated EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL. We may terminate the EC2 Reserved Instance Pricing or Savings Plans programs at any time. EC2 Reserved Instances and Savings Plans are nontransferable, except that EC2 Reserved Instances are only transferrable in accordance with the requirements of the RI Marketplace, but Scheduled Instances and Convertible Reserved Instances (as defined on Amazon EC2 detail page on the AWS Site) are not eligible for the RI Marketplace. EC2 Reserved Instances and Savings Plans are noncancellable, so you will owe the applicable fees for the duration of the term you selected, even if the Agreement is terminated. All amounts paid in connection with the EC2 Reserved Instances and Savings Plans are nonrefundable, except that if we terminate the Agreement other than for cause, terminate an individual EC2 Reserved Instance type, or terminate the EC2 Reserved Instance Pricing or Savings Plans programs, we will refund you a pro rata portion of any up-front fee paid in connection with any previously designated EC2 Reserved Instances or Savings Plans. You may not purchase EC2 Reserved Instances for the purpose of reselling them in the RI Marketplace, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your purchase if we suspect you are doing so. Upon expiration or termination of the term of EC2 Reserved Instances or Savings Plans, the reserved pricing will expire and standard on-demand usage prices will apply to any instances. You are responsible for determining if you are subject to any limitations arising from the purchase of EC2 Reserved Instances or Savings Plans. For example, you are responsible for complying with any applicable laws, policies, terms or conditions governing your payment of up-front fees or the expiration of reserved resources, including any fiscal or appropriation laws, or other policies or restrictions governing up-front payments for goods or services.\n\n**4.6.** EC2 Reserved Instance (RI) Marketplace.\n\n**4.6.1.** Eligibility. The rights to an active EC2 Reserved Instance can be offered for sale through the RI Marketplace as long as (1) the remaining term on the Reserved Instance is greater than one month, and (2) your payment of the upfront charge for it has been received and processed (for credit card purchases, 30 days after you have paid the upfront fee, and for invoice purchases, after you have paid the applicable invoice) (a “Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance”). The characteristics of the Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance (e.g., Instance Type, Platform, Region, Availability Zone, Tenancy, Hypervisor, Reserved Instance Type, Duration, and Hourly Price) will remain as originally designated. The term for the Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance will be the remainder of the original EC2 Reserved Instance term rounded down to the nearest month (for example, an EC2 Reserved Instance with 9 months and 16 days until expiration will be listed and sold as a 9 month Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance). You can be a “Seller” if you are a current AWS customer in good standing, you have a Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance associated with your AWS account, and you complete the registration process through your AWS account. Non-U.S.-based entities may not be Sellers without providing the Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding) to establish that you are not a U.S. person. You can be a “Buyer” if you are a current AWS customer in good standing. You can resell an EC2 Reserved Instance that you previously purchased through the RI Marketplace. You may not resell an EC2 Reserved Instance that you purchased through a discount program (Reserved Instance Volume Discounts or otherwise) without obtaining our prior approval.\n\n**4.6.2.** Submitting Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance for Sale. As a Seller, you will set the one-time price for your Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. The hourly price will be the then-current hourly price for that type of EC2 Reserved Instance, and you will not receive any funds collected from payments associated with the hourly prices. You will pay the then-current fee to us specified on the AWS Site when your Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance is sold. Your Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance will be available for sale after you list it in the RI Marketplace, but it will remain yours and you will be able to use it until it is sold. You may remove a listing of Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance from the RI Marketplace at any time before it has been purchased by a Buyer. We may remove Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance from the RI Marketplace at any time for any reason. Once sold and transferred to a Buyer, a Seller will have no rights to that Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance.\n\n**4.6.3.** Our Role. As a Seller, you will be the seller of record of your rights to a Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. Except as expressly set forth in these Service Terms, we are not involved in any underlying transaction between you and any Buyer. We or our affiliates may also participate in the market as a Seller or a Buyer.\n\n**4.6.4.** Processing of Transactions; Collection of Transaction Proceeds. On Seller’s behalf, we will process all payments for Transactions and collect the applicable Transaction Proceeds. “Transaction” means any sale of Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance through the RI Marketplace. “Transaction Proceeds” means the gross sales proceeds received by us from any Transaction. You will ensure that all fees and charges payable by Buyers for Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance are billed and collected through us and you will not offer or establish any alternative means of payment. We may impose transaction limits on some or all Buyers and Sellers relating to the value of any Transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all Transactions or disbursements during a period of time, or the number of Transactions that we will process over a period of time. We may withhold for investigation, or refuse to process, any of your Transactions that we suspect is fraudulent, unlawful or otherwise violates the terms of these Service Terms, the Agreement, or our Acceptable Use Policy. For each Transaction, we will not remit Transaction Proceeds to a Seller, and the Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance will be available to the Buyer, until after we have successfully processed payments for that Transaction from the Buyer.\n\n**4.6.5.** Remittance of Transaction Proceeds to Sellers. At the end of each business day, we will pay to you all due and payable Transaction Proceeds that we have collected as of the date that is 2 business days prior to the date of payment. We will deduct from each payment any applicable fees and charges due to us related to Marketable EC2 Reserved Instances. The applicable fees and charges are posted on the AWS Site and may be changed from time to time. We may withhold, deduct, or setoff any amounts payable by you to us or our affiliates against any Transaction Proceeds. Payments will be made only to an ACH-enabled bank account located in the United States that you register with us. If there is an error in the processing of any Transaction, you authorize us to initiate debit or credit entries to your designated bank account, to correct such error, provided that any such correction is made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we are unable to debit your designated bank account for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit, plus any applicable fees, to any other bank account or payment instrument that you have on file with us or to deduct the debit and applicable fees from future Transaction Proceeds.\n\n**4.6.6.** Taxes. Sellers are responsible for the calculation, validation and payment of any and all sales, use, excise, import, export, value added, withholding and other taxes and duties assessed, incurred or required to be collected (“Taxes”) or paid for any reason in connection with any Transaction and with Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. We are not obliged to determine whether any Taxes apply to any Transaction, and we are not responsible for remitting Taxes to any taxing authority with respect to any Transaction, or for reporting any information (including the payment of Taxes) with respect to any Transaction. Each Seller will indemnify us and our affiliates against any claim or demand for payment of any Taxes imposed in connection with any Transaction, and for any fines, penalties, or similar charges imposed as a result of the Seller’s failure to collect, remit or report any Taxes in connection with any Transaction.\n\n**4.6.7.** Data Collection and Sharing.

While a requested GL Spot Instance remains running, you will be charged the current GL Spot Price in effect at the beginning of each instance hour. We may terminate, stop, or hibernate GL Spot Instances at any time and without any notice to you for AWS capacity requirements. You should configure your game to ensure it is fault tolerant and will correctly handle interruptions. We have no liability whatsoever for any damages, liabilities, losses (including any corruption, deletion, or destruction or loss of data, applications or profits), or any other consequences resulting from our termination, stoppage, or hibernation of any GL Spot Instance. GL Spot Instances may not be used with certain Services, features and third-party software we specify, including those listed in Section 4.4, above.\n\n#### 59\\.
